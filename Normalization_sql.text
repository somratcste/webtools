Normalization : 
The process of separating your data into tables and creating primary keys is called
normalization.

Types : 
1nf , 2nf , 3nf

1. First Normal form (1nf) : 
--eliminate duplicate columns from the same tables  
--Create separate tables for each group of the related data and 
identify  each row with  a unique column or set of columns ( primary key).

2.  Second Normal form(2nf) : 
--Meet all the requirements of the first normal form.
--Remove subsets of data that apply to multiple rows of a table and place them in separate tables.
--Create relationships between these new tables and  their predecessors through the use of foreign keys. 

3. Third Normal Form (3nf) :
--Meet all the requirements of the second normal forms.
--Remove columns that are not dependent upon the primary key.
